# Dashboard Frontend

This is the frontend for the Alpha Rescue Dashboard, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It provides a real-time map and information panels for emergency response coordination.

## Features

- Real-time event updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Interactive Mapbox map showing user and agent locations
- Collapsible information panels for caller, fire department, hospital, police, and paramedic
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh

  - `components/` - UI components (MapboxMap, UserInfoCard, etc.)
  - `output.css` - Tailwind CSS output
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript types for agent and user info
- `public/` - Static assets and HTML template

## Customization

- Mapbox access token is set in [`MapboxMap.tsx`](src/components/MapboxMap.tsx).
- Tailwind CSS is configured via `index.css` and `output.css`.

This frontend expects a backend server (see `dashboard-backend`) providing:
- `/events` SSE endpoint for real-time updates
- `/api/webhook` endpoint for posting new events
